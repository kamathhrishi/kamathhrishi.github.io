<p style="text-align:justify">Deep Learning models are very powerful. Infact they are so poweful that a powerful enough network could just memorize random data without any real correlations [add reference]. This allows us to feed in input,output pairs for some task. But , this doesn't complete the job for tasks yet. </p>
