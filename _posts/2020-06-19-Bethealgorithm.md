<p style="text-align:justify">Personal data is a personal valuable asset , it could be used for economic , social or even malicious benifits. Most internet companies survive on personal data of users in exchange of services. Usually this leads to distributing data to third party services such as advertisers which on a personal level could be a privacy violation. Data is ensured to be distributed with anonymization where identifying attributes are removed. But , this still does not ensure data is anonymous. The increasing available data online gives surface to linkage attacks which involves reidentifying a user from the dataset with common attributes across datasets. One such popular attack is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105">Netflix attack</a>. Usually third party services such as advertisers don't need personal identifying information , but just enough statistical representation of information. This motivates analysis which reflects the global dataset population , but does not capture any personally identifying information. 
DP is based on Fundamental Law of Information Recovery which states that "overly accurate answers to too many questions will destroy privacy in a spectacular way".
<p style="text-align:justify">Differential Privacy (DP) is one take on privacy which ensures that no single individual is affected for being a part of the dataset or data collection process. It not only protects the individuals from linkage attacks but also provides a plausible way of quanitifying privacy loss. </p>
