<p style="text-align:justify">Deep Learning models are very powerful. Infact they are so poweful that a powerful enough network could just memorize random data without any real correlations [add reference]. This allows us to feed in input,output pairs for some task. But , this doesn't complete the job for tasks yet.In conventional machine learning , it required the practinioner to manually look at several images/test and think of possible features that could possibly define the image. Deep learning gives us the flexibility of learning these features from raw images/text. While that definetly is some great progress , it still helps to manually reannotate every image by yourself and clearly think what the defining features of the category or class is. This not only helps remove incorrect labels but also helps understand the biases your algorithm could pick up on. </p>

<p>Let us take an example of the task of Indoor Scene recognition.</p>
