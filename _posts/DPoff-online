<p style="text-align:justify">The previous section articles covered how we could use differential privacy in an online scenario where a user actively queries 
a dataset and gets noisy results. Another possibility is the offline mechanism where in advance the queries are known and a dataset close to the original dataset is synthesized. 
The data owner can then choose to answer queries from this dataset.
