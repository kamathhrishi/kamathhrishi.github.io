Core contributor to PySyft (2018-2019), a framework enabling privacy-preserving deep learning with support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Key Contributions

- **Federated Learning**: Created practical use cases for federated learning with word embeddings
- **Differential Privacy**: Implemented the PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles) method
- **Infrastructure**: Refactored data loaders and added comprehensive type annotations
- **Framework Support**: Worked on both PyTorch and TensorFlow integrations

## Technologies

PyTorch, TensorFlow, Federated Learning, Differential Privacy

## Impact

PySyft is a foundational framework in privacy-preserving AI, enabling researchers and practitioners to train models while maintaining data privacy through techniques like federated learning and differential privacy.
