A hand pose estimation system that performs both hand segmentation and keypoint detection for understanding hand gestures and poses.

## Architecture

Built using an encoder-decoder CNN architecture with ResNet34 as the backbone, combining semantic segmentation for hand region detection with keypoint estimation for finger positions.

## Features

- **Hand Segmentation**: Accurate segmentation of hand regions from complex backgrounds
- **Keypoint Detection**: Precise localization of finger joints and palm landmarks
- **ResNet34 Backbone**: Leverages pretrained ResNet34 for robust feature extraction

## Technologies

PyTorch, Computer Vision, Deep Learning

## Applications

Hand pose estimation enables natural human-computer interaction, gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and virtual/augmented reality applications.
