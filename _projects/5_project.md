---

A deep learning system for detecting and localizing text in street view images using weakly supervised learning techniques.

## Key Achievements

- **34% Reduction in Labeling Time**: Applied knowledge distillation to reduce manual annotation effort
- **Dataset Contributions**: Annotated UCSD SVT and NEOCR datasets for street view text detection
- **Weakly Supervised Learning**: Leveraged weakly labeled data to train robust text detection models

## Technical Approach

Uses CNN-based segmentation and localization with knowledge distillation to train models from weakly labeled examples, significantly reducing the annotation burden while maintaining high accuracy.

## Technologies

PyTorch, OpenCV, Pillow, Computer Vision

## Applications

Street view text detection is crucial for autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and accessibility applications that need to understand text in real-world environments.
