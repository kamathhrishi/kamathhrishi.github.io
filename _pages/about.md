<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
I'm currently wrapping up my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <strong>University of Delaware</strong> (graduating May 2025), where I've been diving deep into machine learning, privacy-preserving systems, and MLOps. Most recently, I worked as a <strong>Research Engineer at Mbd.xyz</strong> deploying large language models and building recommendation systems. Before that, I spent 2.5 years as a <strong>Software Engineer at Ederlabs</strong>, where I built backend systems and CI/CD pipelines. I'm also a core contributor to <strong>OpenMined's PySyft and SyMPC projects</strong>, working on privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks.

I've been an active investor in Indian capital markets for five years, which sparked my passion for building tools that go beyond surface-level data summaries. I founded <strong>StrataLens AI</strong>, an equity research platform with agentic RAG pipelines for earnings calls and SEC filings, and built <strong>themarketcast.ai</strong> to make private capital formation trends more accessible. My work spans language models, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and MLOps—particularly where they intersect with finance, security, and infrastructure. I'm passionate about systems that combine rigorous engineering with practical applications that provide actionable insights.
