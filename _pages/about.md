I'm a software engineer and researcher specializing in machine learning, privacy-preserving systems, and MLOps. Currently pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Delaware (graduating May 2025).

## Professional Experience

Most recently, I worked as a Research Engineer at Mbd.xyz where I deployed large language models using ONNXRuntime and developed recommendation system bridging techniques. Previously, I spent 2.5 years as a Software Engineer at Ederlabs, building backend systems and CI/CD pipelines.

I'm a core contributor to OpenMined's PySyft and SyMPC projects, focusing on privacy-preserving machine learning. I also developed themarketcast.ai, an AI service that summarized S&P 500 earnings calls.

## Technical Interests

My work spans language models, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and MLOps principles. I'm particularly interested in systems that combine MLOps with practical applications in finance, security, and infrastructure.

## Beyond Code

I've been an active investor in Indian capital markets for five years using fundamental analysis. I'm passionate about capital markets strategy and building analytical tools that provide actionable insights beyond surface-level data summaries.
