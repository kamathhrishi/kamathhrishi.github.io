<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
Hello, I am Hrishikesh Kamath. Software engineer with experience building full-stack applications and AI agents. Previously core contributor to <strong>PySyft</strong>, one of the most widely used privacy-preserving machine learning libraries, and founding engineer at an Accel-backed startup in India. I recently completed my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <strong>University of Delaware</strong>, where I worked on research in LLM code generation and hardware security (logic locking). Before that, I spent 2.5 years as a <strong>Software Engineer at Ederlabs</strong>, building backend systems and CI/CD pipelines.

I've been an active investor in Indian capital markets for five years, which sparked my passion for building tools that go beyond surface-level data summaries. Most recently, I built <strong>StrataLens AI</strong>, an equity research platform with agentic RAG pipelines for earnings calls and SEC filings. While I decided not to continue it as a product, I'm still actively working on it as a project alongside <strong>themarketcast.ai</strong>, a platform for analyzing private capital formation trends. My work spans language models, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and MLOps—particularly where they intersect with finance, security, and infrastructure.

<strong>Open to engineering roles at high-growth companies in San Francisco and New York.</strong>
